# Pokemon meets Zelda inspired early 2000s RPG

An early-2000s Gameboy Pokemon meets Legends of Zelda inspired RPG game where the player can interact with the world, the NPCs, and Pokemon within it to a higher degree than the original games while solving Legends of Zelda inspired quests (with some witty humor of course).

Current work in progress. Has a base starting map and sprites made with conrols set up. 

Next step to do:
Add collisions
